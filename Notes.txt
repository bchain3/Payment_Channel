Signature replay attack
- Lets say Alice creates  twounidirectional payment contracts to pay Bob and Charlie 1 ETH each
- since we create the signature using only amount Bob can claim eth given to Charlie
- so we create signature with channel (contract) address and amount

Program Flow
- Create the contract
- send contract the required amount of funds
- sign a transaction that says someone is allowed to withdraw x amount of funds from the contract
- let that someone withdraw those funds 
- prevent reentrancy
- in case of disagreement selfdestruct the contract
- in case of expiry selfdestruct the contract
